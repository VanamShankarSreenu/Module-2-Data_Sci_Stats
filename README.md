# MODULE 2: DS statistics assignment

## code results and visualisations
 - Statistical Concepts & Assignment 2.1.ipynb

# Data Exploration: Data Handling and Formatting
 - Formatted flavor column present in the Product Launch Dataset using programmic logic
 - Created a list of unique flavors based on your analysis.Gave count of the total number 
   of unique flavors.
 - Histogram of market subcategory against eventdate (years). Found categories showing negative trend over
   years by fitting line and looking for negative slope.
-  Market subcategory has highest unique flavors.

# 2. Data Exploration: Merging and Manipulating Datasets
  - Mapping flavours of product release to flavor group .
  - Mapping position of product release to position group.
  - Visualisation  of product launches over different quarters for “fruit” flavor


# 3. Data Formatting, Merging and Manipulating Dataset
  - Visualisation showing ethical and consumption position group vs total products being launched.

# 4. Data Aggregation
  - Generate monthly, quarterly and yearly summary statistics of product launches.
  - Present in ~$Product Launch Dataset Data aggregation.xlsx

# 5. Data Exploration: Filtering and Subsetting 
  - Visualisation of TOP 5 unique flavors across each countries in 2013

# 6. Hypothesis Testing: TOP 5 Positioning Groups
   - Visualisation of TOP TOP 5 Positioning Groups.
   - Done T test.
   - H0:,Average of  positioning groups launches is  u = X.
   - H1: Average of positioning groups launches is  u less than X.
   - u is the mean of all positon groups product launch count avg.
    x is the mean of 5 positon groups product launch count avg
    rejected H0 and accepted H1 after T test
